Thanks for the comment :) I haven&#039;t seen it, but I will look out for it. It is shocking to see them killed like that. I saw a picture on someone&#039;s Facebook page of a pig on a spit-roast. You can see the pain in its eyes.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Oh, and have you watched &#039;Temple Grandin&#039; Movie starring Claire Danes...I think she&#039;s right that those cows deserve to be treated rightly because their lives are spared for us to live.

					<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s a documentary film I watched fairy recently called Earthlings, which very nearly made me go vegan on the spot. It&#039;s not so much a matter of killing animals for food, but rather how we have made slaves of other species for food, fur and entertainment. The way that animals are treated BEFORE being slaughtered for food is not something than we humans should be proud of. We have become &#039;speciesists&#039; and exert our dominance over other animals. Give Earthlings a watch Dave. I dare you.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Dave, thanks for the comment. I don&#039;t believe people are stupid, well not all of them at least :) I think that being so far removed from the process, which we are, makes us less inclined to really engage with it. We are disconnected from it, we don&#039;t correctly interrogate the brutality and excess of our daily habits.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Dave. I&#039;d be surprised if they were fully aware of the process and weren&#039;t a bit shaken. We&#039;re all good people - right? People who consider our footprints and the effects of our presence. All jumping on the &#039;keen to be green&#039; band wagon. The rate at which we now consume meat is exhausting the natural resource. And sure - meat is meat and we must eat, and that is our place in the food chain. But there is nothing natural about the way we&#039;re doing this anymore. 

FYI: fast food is hardly meat anymore - mass production, innit.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Do you think people are really that stupid that they don&#039;t know where meat comes from? Amid the still warm, maimed and unnecessarily flowery language, you&#039;re telling us stuff we already know and don&#039;t care about. 

Not sure what effect this was meant to have, but I&#039;m dying for a Steers burger now. True story.]]></description>
